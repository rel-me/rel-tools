# Rel tools

Open-source command-line, MCP, and Rust clients for
[Rel](https://rel.me), plus the public contract for its local versioned API.

Rel is not an open-source product. This repository intentionally contains only
clients and documentation for integrating with the proprietary macOS app. It
does not contain Rel.app, the local agent implementation, Chromium integration,
session storage, proxy credentials, or internal service code.

## What is here

- [`rel-cli`](crates/rel-cli): the `rel` command and its stdio MCP adapter.
- [`rel-client`](crates/rel-client): a typed synchronous Rust client for RPC v1.
- [`plugins/rel`](plugins/rel): the Rel plugin for Codex, distributed through
  this repository's marketplace.
- [`docs`](docs): the canonical Actions, CLI, MCP, RPC, and Rust SDK
  documentation that powers [docs.rel.me](https://docs.rel.me).

All clients require Rel.app in `/Applications`; they connect only to its
loopback API. Download the app from [rel.me](https://rel.me).

## Install the CLI

The app's **Settings → General → Install Command Line** task installs the
bundled, matching CLI into a writable directory already in `PATH`. To build the
public client independently:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/rel-me/rel-tools \
  --tag v0.1.1 \
  --package rel-cli
```

Then try:

```sh
rel health
rel https://rel.me
```

Capture writes page data to standard output and events to standard error. Use
`rel navigate`, `rel perform`, and argument-free `rel capture` for a stateful
page workflow. `rel tab` is an alias for `rel session`.
See the [Actions reference](docs/ACTIONS.md) for every supported browser
interaction and its JSON shape.

## Install the Codex plugin

The repository is also a Codex plugin marketplace. Add it once, then install
the Rel plugin:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add rel-me/rel-tools
codex plugin add rel@rel
```

Start a new Codex task after installation. The plugin configures the bundled
`rel mcp` adapter and adds guidance for safe use of persistent browser sessions.
Rel.app must be installed in `/Applications`.

## Use the Rust client

Until a crates.io release is announced, pin the public repository tag:

```toml
[dependencies]
rel-client = { git = "https://github.com/rel-me/rel-tools", tag = "v0.1.1" }
```

```rust,no_run
use rel_client::RelClient;

let client = RelClient::local();
let status = client.status()?;
println!("{}", status.data.overall_status);
# Ok::<(), rel_client::ClientError>(())
```

See the [Rust SDK guide](docs/SDK.md) and [RPC v1 contract](docs/RPC.md).

## Development

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace

cd docs
npm ci
npm run check
```
