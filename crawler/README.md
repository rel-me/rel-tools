# REL Python crawler

`rel-crawler` is a restartable, one-level website crawler for REL's supported
loopback RPC v1 API. It opens selected links in the same embedded Chromium
session, captures rendered HTML, returns with browser-history Back, and then
continues with the next link.

The library has no runtime dependencies. Request-oriented crawlers such as
Scrapy remain a better fit for ordinary HTTP spiders; use this library when a
site requires REL's visible browser state, configured Profile, native input, or
history-preserving interaction.

## Requirements and installation

- macOS with REL open and healthy.
- Python 3.11 or newer.
- An existing REL Profile if the crawl needs one. The crawler accepts only the
  Profile name and never creates or changes Profiles or proxies.

Install from a clone:

```sh
cd crawler
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e .
```

The Release API defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:17319/v1`. Set
`REL_AGENT_PORT`, or pass `rel_base_url`, when using another supported runtime.
RELDebug normally uses port `27319`.

## Run the Hacker News example

The public example crawls discussion links from the Hacker News front page. Its
server-rendered markup provides a compact demonstration of exact link clicks,
query-based output paths, target readiness, and browser-history Back. It does
not run during tests.

```sh
cd crawler
HN_MAX_LINKS=3 .venv/bin/rel-crawler run examples/hackernews.py:app
```

It uses the existing `Direct` Profile by default. To select another existing
Profile by name:

```sh
REL_PROFILE=Research \
  .venv/bin/rel-crawler run examples/hackernews.py:app
```

Omit `HN_MAX_LINKS` to process every selected discussion on the source page. Set
`HN_START_URL` to use another public Hacker News listing such as `newest`,
`show`, or `ask`. If the named Profile does not exist, REL returns an error and
the crawler stops; it does not create a replacement Profile.

The example writes captures under `examples/hackernews-output/`, mapping the
query-based item ID to a readable URL-derived path:

```text
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=123456
  -> item/123456/index.html
  -> item/123456/index.metadata.json
```

Query variants use `index.query-<hash>.html` so they cannot overwrite one
another. The complete URL remains in the metadata sidecar.

## Define a crawl

```python
from pathlib import Path
from urllib.parse import urlsplit

from rel_crawler import CapturedPage, CrawlApplication, CrawlDefinition, Link

root = Path("post-crawl").resolve()

def select_post(link: Link) -> bool:
    parsed = urlsplit(link.url)
    return parsed.hostname == "example.com" and parsed.path.startswith("/posts/")

def report(capture: CapturedPage) -> None:
    print(capture.url, capture.output_path, capture.metadata_path)

definition = CrawlDefinition(
    start_url="https://example.com/posts/",
    select_link=select_post,
    process_capture=report,
    source_ready_selector="main .post-list",
    capture_ready_selector="article.post",
)

app = CrawlApplication(
    definition=definition,
    state_path=root / "checkpoint.json",
    capture_dir=root / "pages",
    profile="Direct",
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(app.run())
```

`select_link` receives REL's rendered interactive links in DOM order. The
default discovery keeps enabled anchors with usable layout bounds, including
clickable links currently outside the viewport because native clicking can
scroll to them. Relative links are resolved, fragments removed, non-HTTP links
skipped, and internationalized URLs converted to stable ASCII URIs for exact
clicking. `Link.original_url` preserves the readable IRI. Supply
`extract_links` only when a crawl intentionally needs a custom captured-HTML
parser, and `capture_path` for a custom output layout.

## Command line

A crawler configuration exports a `CrawlApplication`, conventionally named
`app`. Run a Python file or importable module; `:app` is optional:

```sh
.venv/bin/rel-crawler run path/to/crawl.py
.venv/bin/python -m rel_crawler run package.crawl:app
```

Runtime flags override application defaults without changing the file. For
example, retry links previously recorded as terminal failures with fresh
attempt budgets:

```sh
.venv/bin/rel-crawler run path/to/crawl.py --retry-failed
```

Useful overrides include `--profile NAME`, `--max-links N`,
`--action-delay SECONDS`, `--max-attempts N`, and
`--max-session-restarts N`. Only a Profile name is accepted; there is no proxy
alias option. Logs and callback output go to stderr, while the final crawl
summary is emitted as JSON on stdout.

## Readiness, pacing, and browser history

REL performs this sequence for every selected child page:

1. Navigate to the source and wait for `source_ready_selector`.
2. Click the exact normalized link with native auto-scroll enabled, wait for
   `capture_ready_selector`, and capture the rendered HTML.
3. Go Back through browser history and wait for the source selector again.

Selectors are condition waits, not fixed sleeps. Choose page-specific selectors
that prove the expected content is ready and do not also match the other page.
The separate `action_delay` defaults to two seconds between browser actions;
set it to zero to disable crawler-side pacing.

The rendered observation rejects disabled and zero-size anchors, reducing stale
or inactive duplicate links that appear only in captured HTML. A rendered link
can still detach or change before it is clicked. Such a link is retried within
the configured bound and then checkpointed as failed so it cannot trap the
crawl. The crawler refuses a truncated REL observation rather than silently
processing only part of a source page.

## Incremental source pages

For a source that appends more links in place, configure a clickable control
and a bounded number of expansions:

```python
definition = CrawlDefinition(
    start_url="https://example.com/posts/",
    select_link=select_post,
    load_more_selector="button.load-more",
    load_more_clicks=10,
)
```

After finishing each batch, the crawler scrolls to and clicks the control, then
polls REL's rendered links until new URLs appear. Completed expansions are
replayed after a managed-session replacement so the crawl resumes at the same
depth. Load-more mode uses rendered discovery and cannot be combined with a
custom captured-HTML `extract_links` callback.

## Checkpoints and session recovery

The crawler atomically checkpoints discovery, attempts, captures, failures, and
session generation after every transition. An attempt is charged before the
click, so a process crash cannot retry one link forever. Existing capture files
are skipped by default and logged.

New crawls create a dedicated persistent REL session in a deterministic group.
The checkpoint reuses that session after a process restart. If a crawler-owned
session becomes unavailable, a bounded recovery closes it when possible,
creates a replacement from the same named Profile, reloads the source, and
resumes. Caller-owned `session_id` values are never replaced automatically.

The defaults retry each link once (`max_attempts=2`) and permit one session
replacement per link (`max_session_restarts=1`). A terminal action failure or
HTTP 403, 429, or 5xx result rotates a managed session before the crawler moves
on. Failed links remain terminal on later invocations unless `retry_failed=True`
or the CLI's `--retry-failed` flag explicitly requeues them with fresh attempts.

## Capture metadata

Every HTML capture has a sibling `.metadata.json` file containing:

- a timezone-aware UTC `captured_at` timestamp;
- crawl, checkpoint, link, and session identity;
- final page URL, HTTP status, byte size, title, and canonical URL;
- all rendered `<meta>` records; and
- published and modified timestamps advertised through common meta,
  schema.org, Dublin Core, element, and JSON-LD fields.

Page-derived metadata is untrusted input. Existing HTML without a sidecar is
backfilled when skipped, and older sidecars are upgraded without changing the
original capture time.

## Test

Tests use a fake REL client and a loopback HTTP server; they never visit an
external website:

```sh
cd crawler
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
