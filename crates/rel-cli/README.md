# rel-cli

`rel-cli` provides the `rel` command and its MCP stdio adapter for the local,
versioned API exposed by Rel.app. It contains no browser runtime, session
storage, proxy credentials, or proprietary app implementation.

Rel.app must be installed in `/Applications`. The CLI starts it when a command
requires the local API service.

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/gabriel/rel-tools --package rel-cli
rel health
rel navigate https://example.com
rel capture > example.html
```

See [`docs/CLI.md`](../../docs/CLI.md) and
[`docs/MCP.md`](../../docs/MCP.md) for the complete command and MCP contracts.
